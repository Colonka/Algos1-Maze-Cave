# Algos1-Maze-Cave

Implemetation of the basic algorithms of Maze and Cave handling (generation, rendering, solving) and ML algorithm (Q-learning method) for teaching an agent the shortest passage of mazes.

## Introduction

In this project I've developed desktop app which allow Maze and Cave handling such as generation, rendering, solving. In addition to I've implemented ML algorithm (Q-learning method) for teaching an agent the shortest passage of mazes. GUI developed by Qt 6.5.
